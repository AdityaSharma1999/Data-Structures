### Introduction

This repository contains some important data strucuture problems and algorithms I have solved in Java

### Data Structures and related problems
The repositiry conatins implementations on the following data strucutures

Stacks 
Queues
LinkedList
Generic Trees
Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees
Heaps
Hash Tables

## Further More Description will be added in some time to the various problems solved
